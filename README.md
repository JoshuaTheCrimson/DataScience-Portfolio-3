# Comprehensive Analysis of an E-commerce Dataset: Part 3 (Semester 2, 2023)

## **Introduction & Context**
As e-commerce continues to flourish, understanding user preferences becomes quintessential for businesses. In this third iteration of our series, housed within this repository is a Jupyter Notebook designed meticulously to shed light on the intricacies of user ratings. Our chosen tools for this venture? Classification models—namely, Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).

## **Objective & Focus**
The core intent of this project pivots around deciphering the capabilities of distinct machine learning models, probing how they fare in the arena of predicting user item ratings. However, our approach isn't just a mad dash to accuracy. We place an accentuated emphasis on the journey—the methodologies, the iterations, and the nuances. In doing so, we aspire to create a pedagogical narrative, beneficial not just in outcomes, but in process understanding.

## **Detailed Exploration Process**

1. **Data Acquaintance**: Before diving into modeling, we commence with a deep dive into the dataset, understanding its shape, features, and potential nuances.
2. **Data Cleaning**: In this phase, we rectify anomalies, handle missing values, and ensure that the data is in its prime form for subsequent steps.
3. **Feature Engineering & Encoding**: Recognizing that our models thrive on numerical data, categorical features are diligently encoded. Additionally, new features are engineered, borne out of existing data, to enhance model performance.
4. **Model Training & Evaluation**: With our data prepped, we plunge into the heart of our analysis, training our Logistic Regression and KNN models. Post-training, a meticulous evaluation follows, deciphering model strengths, areas of improvement, and insights.

## **Prerequisites & Toolkit**

To ensure a seamless experience replicating our analysis or building upon it, here's the technology stack we've employed:

- **Python 3.x**: Our foundational programming language, chosen for its extensive libraries and versatility in data manipulation.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: An interactive platform, melding together code, visuals, and rich text—ideal for our exploratory analysis.
- **Pandas**: A cornerstone for data handling, from reading datasets to transformations.
- **scikit-learn**: A machine learning library that stands as the bedrock for our classification models and evaluation metrics.

## **Concluding Note**
E-commerce is dynamic, and so is user behavior. Through this project, we seek to bridge the gap between user sentiment and the items they interact with, providing businesses with a blueprint to better cater to their audience.
